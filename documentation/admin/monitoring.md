Monitoring
----------

Database monitoring is possible by getting current [dynamic statistics](../tutorial/configuration.md) and configuration via
[sp_env()](../api/sp_env.md) object.

To get per-thread backtrace see [Scheduler](../conf/scheduler.md),

To get per-database metrics see [Database](../conf/db.md),
[Performance](../conf/db_performance.md) and [Scheduler](../conf/db_scheduler.md) sections.
